1、查询“001”课程比“002”课程成绩高的所有学生的学号；

SELECT 
   s1.s_id
FROM
(select s_id,score from sc where c_id='001') s1,
(select s_id,score from sc where c_id='002') s2
WHERE
s1.s_id = s2.s_id and s1.score > s2.score 

2、查询平均成绩大于60分的同学的学号和平均成绩；

SELECT
s.s_id,ROUND(AVG(score),2)
FROM
sc s
GROUP BY
s.s_id
HAVING
AVG(score) > 60

3、查询所有同学的学号、姓名、选课数、总成绩；

SELECT
st.s_id,st.s_name,COUNT(sc.c_id),ROUND(NVL(SUM(sc.score),0),2)
FROM
student st,sc
WHERE st.s_id = sc.s_id(+)
GROUP BY st.s_id,st.s_name

4、查询姓“李”的老师的个数；

SELECT COUNT(t_id) FROM teacher where t_name like '李%'  
  
5、查询没学过“叶平”老师课的同学的学号、姓名；

select s_id,s_name from student 
minus
select s.s_id,s.s_name from student s,sc,
(select c.c_id from course c,teacher t where t.t_id = c.t_id and t.t_name = '叶平') q
where s.s_id = sc.s_id and sc.c_id = q.c_id

6、查询学过“001”并且也学过编号“002”课程的同学的学号、姓名；

select DISTINCT st.s_id,st.s_name
from student st,sc,course c
where st.s_id = sc.s_id and sc.c_id = c.c_id and c.c_id = '001'
INTERSECT
select DISTINCT st.s_id,st.s_name
from student st,sc,course c
where st.s_id = sc.s_id and sc.c_id = c.c_id and c.c_id = '002'

7、查询学过“叶平”老师所教的所有课的同学的学号、姓名；

SELECT DISTINCT s.s_id,s.s_name
FROM sc,student s,course c
where s.s_id = sc.s_id and sc.c_id = c.c_id and c.c_id in (select co.c_id from course co,teacher t where co.t_id = t.t_id and t.t_name = '叶平')

8、查询课程编号“002”的成绩比课程编号“001”课程低的所有同学的学号、姓名；

SELECT
s.s_id,s.s_name
FROM
student s,
(select s_id,score from sc where c_id = '002') s1,
(select s_id,score from sc where c_id='001') s2
WHERE s.s_id = s1.s_id and s1.s_id = s2.s_id and s1.score < s2.score

9、查询所有课程成绩小于60分的同学的学号、姓名；

SELECT DISTINCT s.s_id,s.s_name
FROM student s,(SELECT s_id FROM sc WHERE score < 60) s2
WHERE s.s_id = s2.s_id

10、查询没有学全所有课的同学的学号、姓名；

SELECT
   s.s_id,s.s_name
FROM student s,sc
where s.s_id = sc.s_id(+)
GROUP BY s.s_id,s.s_name
HAVING COUNT(sc.c_id)<(select COUNT(c_id) from course )

11、查询至少有一门课与学号为“1001”的同学所学相同的同学的学号和姓名；

SELECT DISTINCT s.s_id,s.s_name
FROM student s,sc,
(select sc.c_id from sc where sc.s_id = '1001') c
WHERE s.s_id = sc.s_id and sc.c_id in c.c_id and s.s_id != '1001'

12、查询至少学过学号为“001”同学所有一门课的其他同学学号和姓名；
